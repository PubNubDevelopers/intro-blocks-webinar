Code for the Intro to Blocks webinar

https://www.pubnub.com/developers/webinars/2016-11-11-introduction-to-pubnub-blocks/


The files `chat.html` and `code.js` contain the chat interface. The real work is done by the BLOCK code
in the `js-before-publish` directory. You will need to copy this code into your own BLOCK
on the [PubNub website](https://admin.pubnub.com/).
